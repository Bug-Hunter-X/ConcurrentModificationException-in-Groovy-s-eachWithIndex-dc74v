This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using Groovy's `eachWithIndex` method to iterate and modify a list simultaneously.  The `eachWithIndex` method iterates through the list, but attempting to modify the list (e.g., using `remove()`) during iteration can lead to a `ConcurrentModificationException`. The solution shows how to avoid this exception using a copy of the list or an iterator with `remove()`.
